dmus2mid - DMX MUS to MID converter
-----------------------------------

The DMX MUS format is used in quite a few old games, particularly those built on
top of the DOOM engine. The format is essentially a type 0 MIDI file with some
space-saving measures implemented. Examples of games that use it are:

 * DOOM
 * DOOM II
 * Strife
 * Heretic
 * Raptor

Do note that to convert MUS files from Raptor, you have to pass in -t 70 to the
program. The default behavior is to use 140 ticks per quarter note, because
Raptor is to my knowledge the only game that does not use 140 ticks per quarter
note, but rather uses 70 ticks per quarter note.

Build
-----

Fairly standard, just run 'make' in the terminal. There will be an executable
file in the same directory named 'dmus2mid'.

Usage
------

dmus2mid [options] [file.mus] [file.mid]

-h      Print this help text
-t      Specify ticks per quarter note. Examples:
        70  - Only Raptor uses this for the DMX MUS format
        140 - DOOM, Strife, Hexen etc. have 140 TPQN
-f      Specify a factor to TPQN and tempo. May increase quality
-z      Enable zero-velocity NOTE_ON events, may help compression
-e      Disable zero-velocity NOTE_ON events, disabled by default
-r      Enable running mode for compression, enabled by default
-u      Disable running mode for compression, shouldn't be necessary

If conflicting options are passed to the program (example: -r -u), the latter
conflicting argument takes precedence.
